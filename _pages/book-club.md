Book Club is currently on hiatus. 

We wrapped up reading Data & Reality by Bill Kent in early July 2025. At some point I'll select the next book to read together, but that probably won't be for a while. Instead of hosting a book club, I'll be participating in [Joe Reis'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/) book club, which will [kick off](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josephreis_join-the-practicaldata-discord-server-activity-7351779275605225472-LCxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAiK2FABKHqWAaEnq7CdATQwY_GSauRe0Xg) in late July 2025 with "Kill it with Fire: Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)" by Marianne Bellotti.

## Why start a book club?

1. Because other people said I should
2. Because I've always wanted to
3. Because I can gather together people who want to read the same books I want to read and then we can all talk about it, which happens to be my idea of fun
4. [Because](https://bsky.app/profile/jennajordan.me/post/3l7tecbxnr424) I [said](https://bsky.app/profile/jennajordan.me/post/3l7wgfka5kx22) I [would](https://bsky.app/profile/jennajordan.me/post/3la7sp2hvuf2h)
5. Accountability for reading nonfiction books I genuinely want to read but struggle with because... nonfiction  

## Past Books

The first book was "Data & Reality" by Bill Kent (2nd ed). We read & met about this book from January - July 2025.

> Once more: we are not modeling reality, but the way information about reality is processed, by people. 
>
> â€” Bill Kent, Data & Reality

Why "Data & Reality"? [Because!](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/why-you-should-read-data-and-reality/) If the above quote isn't enough of a clue, this book provides a philosophical foundation for our work as data people. And philosophy is meant to be discussed, which makes it a perfect book club book.

You can download a PDF of this book at: [https://github.com/jhulick/bookstuff/blob/master/Data%20and%20Reality.pdf](https://github.com/jhulick/bookstuff/blob/master/Data%20and%20Reality.pdf)

If you'd like to put this book on your e-reader and need to convert it, I recommend using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com).

But Jenna, why the 2nd edition? Well, first of all it's free and readily available via the above link, so it is accessible. But the canonical answer is in [this blog post from Hillel Wayne](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/data-and-reality-2nd-edition/). If you really want a physical book, you can get the 3rd edition, but be warned that the content is not the same.
