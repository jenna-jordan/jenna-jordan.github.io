As a mission-driven data engineer in civic tech, I advise public sector clients on data & analytics engineering best practices. I ground my data engineering work in information science principles, and bring a data librarian's perspective to modern data teams. Now a Senior Analytics Engineer with Ratio PBC, I build data systems that support public health initiatives and Health & Human Services organizations. 

During my time as a Senior Consultant with Analytics8, I developed particular expertise in dbt Mesh architecture and the governance strategies that should accompany it. My experiences working with dbt Mesh projects inspired my peer exchange session at Coalesce 2024, which allowed participants to explore mesh governance challenges through a role-playing simulation game.

During my first foray into the civic tech space, I spearheaded the adoption of dbt core at the City of Boston Analytics team. As a Data Engineer on the Analytics team, I built the project & architecture from scratch, reorganized the team's data warehouse & ETL pipelines, and presented on this migration at Coalesce 2023. I also started the City Analytics Exchange, a community for data analytics practitioners in local government.

I earned my MSLIS (Masters in Library & Information Science) in May 2020, and I'm proud to say that I learned to code at library school. I created this website & started writing blog posts during my graduate degree, and I now write posts on topics like analytical data warehouses and data engineering best practices.

When not transforming data (and the organizations data flows through), I'm a knitter, board gamer, dog mom, and voracious consumer of all things sci-fi & fantasy.
