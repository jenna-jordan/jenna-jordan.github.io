As a data engineer, I use SQL and python to wrangle data into shape. I create and maintain the pipelines that keep high-quality data flowing to vital dashboards, reports, and published data. I design data systems that house and integrate data from a multitude of sources - cleaning, munging, and reshaping along the way. 

As a data engineer in the civic tech space, I am driven by the knowledge that my work directly contributes to improving government service delivery and has a positive impact on my community. The data and systems that I work with have the potential to improve constituent's daily lives when handled with care and integrity. 

While I am continually learning new tools and bringing that new knowledge to my team (dbt!), my data work will always be grounded in information science. I'm proud to say that I learned how to code at library school - and I will forever be grateful to my MSLIS degree for providing the foundation of all the technical work that I do.

I am also a knitter, a dog mom to my adorable rescue Bella, a board gamer, and a voracious reader of all things sci-fi & fantasy.
