I adapted content from a variety of other Carpentries workshops teaching git to develop my "Intro to Git & GitHub (Speedrun edition)" workshop. 

[Check out my adapted Carpentries lesson "Intro to Git & GitHub (Speedrun edition)"](http://jennajordan.me/git-novice-speedrun/)

The goal of this lesson is to introduce core git concepts and commands while following a common git workflow pattern. Learners will start with creating a repository on GitHub, then use VS Code to clone the repo, make edits locally, and push those changes to the remote GitHub repo.

This workshop prioritizes speed over completeness, as my primary goal for adapting the original content was to be able to teach it in 1-2 hours rather than the original 4 hours. I also prioritized a typical developer flow, including tools like VS Code, rather than seeking to teach git in isolation on the command line, as well as concepts important for working on a team like branches and Pull Requests.

This workshop was published in early 2025, and I have since taught it a number of times - to clients while working at Analytics8, to clients while working at Ratio, and to the Spring, Summer, and Fall 2025 student cohorts of the [BU Spark! Technology Innovation Program](https://www.bu.edu/spark/about/what-we-do/). It is ready to be taught by other instructors - if you would like to do so, please let me know!
