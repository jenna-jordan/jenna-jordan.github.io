      description:
        - Presented my poster advocating the use of relational databases in the data curation process, especially for datasets that are published separately but can be used together due to a common identifier scheme and shared attributes. 
        - The Correlates of War datasets are used as an illustrative example to show how the normalization process results in a design with greater data reusability, while check constraints and foreign key constraints can improve data quality.
